    <p> <b>Bhagwan Swaminarayan:</b> Bhagwan Swaminarayan founded the Swaminarayan Sampraday, a Hindu sect that emphasizes devotion to God, morality, and spiritual upliftment. He established a spiritual lineage of gurus (spiritual masters) to guide his followers and preserve his teachings.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Shastriji Maharaj (Shastri Yagnapurushdas):</b> Shastriji Maharaj, also known as Yogiji Maharaj, was a prominent spiritual leader within the Swaminarayan Sampraday. He played a crucial role in revitalizing the sect and promoting its teachings among devotees. Shastriji Maharaj initiated numerous social and spiritual initiatives, laying the groundwork for the formal organization of BAPS.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Establishment of BAPS:</b> In 1907, Shastriji Maharaj formally established BAPS as a spiritual and social organization dedicated to the teachings of Bhagwan Swaminarayan. BAPS aimed to promote spiritual values, provide humanitarian services, and foster community development. Shastriji Maharaj emphasized the importance of devotion, moral values, and service to others as integral aspects of BAPS' mission.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Expansion and Leadership Succession:</b> After Shastriji Maharaj's passing in 1951, Pramukh Swami Maharaj emerged as the spiritual leader and head of BAPS. Under his guidance, BAPS experienced significant growth and expansion, both in India and internationally. Pramukh Swami Maharaj initiated various temple construction projects, social service initiatives, and educational programs, furthering the organization's reach and impact.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Contemporary Development:</b>Today, BAPS continues to thrive as a global Hindu organization with millions of followers worldwide. It operates temples, educational institutions, hospitals, and charitable projects aimed at promoting spiritual and social welfare. BAPS is renowned for its architectural marvels, such as the Akshardham complexes in Gandhinagar, Delhi, and other cities, which serve as spiritual and cultural hubs.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, the origin of BAPS can be traced back to the teachings of Bhagwan Swaminarayan and the efforts of spiritual leaders like Shastriji Maharaj and Pramukh Swami Maharaj to propagate these teachings and establish a vibrant spiritual community dedicated to serving humanity.
