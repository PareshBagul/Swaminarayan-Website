<p>Bardoli is small city 30 kilometers away from Surat. It is home to one of the largest sugar factories in Asia, the Bardoli Sugar Factory. Bardoli has grown into a hub for trade and academics because of the increasing population and the investment of money and resources into developing the local economy. The BAPS Swaminarayan Chhatralaya, Bardoli houses over a couple of hundred students. Many of the students attend Gujarat Technological University in Bardoli. The Chhatralaya holds prayer sessions twice a day and encourages students to enroll in many of its humanitarian service programs in southern Gujarat. Sadhus and guest speakers address the students once a week with motivational talks to spur academic and professional progress. The hostel was inaugurated in 2008 and, since then, has greatly contributed to the academic landscape of Bardoli and southern Gujarat.</p>
